# ChromeExtension to modify CSS

## How to use

open chrome extensions:
chrome://extensions/

enable developer mode

"Load unpacked" --> load folder

manifest match eg.
"matches": ["https://meet.google.com/*"]

and to styles what you want to modify.

I used this mainly to make Google Meets MUTE icon to pop out more (this has worked over a year now...)
